### Core Natural Language Processing and Query Translation

- "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017) - This seminal paper introduced the Transformer architecture, which has revolutionized natural language processing and underpins many state-of-the-art models used for understanding and translating natural language queries.

- "Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries from Natural Language using Reinforcement Learning" by Zhong et al. (2017) - This paper explores the use of reinforcement learning for translating natural language queries into SQL, offering insights into training models for this specific task.

- "Semantic Parsing for Single-Relation Question Answering" by Berant et al. (2013) - While focused on single-relation questions, this paper provides foundational understanding of semantic parsing techniques relevant to extracting meaning and structure from natural language queries.

### **Database Interaction and Optimization**

- "Query Optimization" by Garcia-Molina et al. (1999) - This classic textbook chapter offers a comprehensive overview of query optimization techniques, essential for ensuring efficient execution of generated SQL queries.

- "An Overview of Query Optimization in Relational Systems" by Chaudhuri (1998) - This survey paper provides additional insights into query optimization strategies and their impact on database performance.

### Response Generation and User Experience

- "Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks" by See et al. (2017) - This paper introduces a technique for generating abstractive summaries with pointer-generator networks, relevant for creating concise and informative natural language responses from retrieved data.

- "Natural Language Generation for Data Visualization" by Elzer et al. (2019) - This work explores the use of natural language generation techniques for describing and explaining data visualizations, which can enhance the user experience by providing richer and more insightful responses.
